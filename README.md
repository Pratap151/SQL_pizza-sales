This project explores a fictional pizza sales database using SQL to uncover key business insights. 
It includes a wide range of queries that analyze order volume, revenue, pizza popularity, and customer ordering trends.
Through SQL, this analysis answers questions like:

- How many orders were placed?

- Which pizza sizes and types are most popular?

- What times of day see the most orders?

- Which pizzas generate the most revenue?

- How does revenue grow over time?

This project is a great example of how SQL can be used to transform raw sales data into useful insights for decision-making in a business context.
